# Intro

The purpose of this GitHub repository is to document the work I completed during a Java bootcamp at the Escuela de Organizaci√≥n Industrial. The repository contains comprehensive information about the fundamental concepts of programming, Java and object-oriented programming, relational databases, and front-end development tools. Additionally, the repository includes the exercises I completed during the bootcamp to showcase my practical skills in these areas.

## Content

During this bootcamp, I was introduced to the fundamental concepts of programming that are common to any language. This included a range of topics, from strings, loops, data types, variables, methods, and functions, to more advanced concepts in Java and object-oriented programming such as inheritance, polymorphism, and method overloading. In addition, I gained knowledge in various data types used in Java, such as ArrayLists, Streams, Interfaces, and Enumerations.

Following this, I progressed to learning about relational databases such as MySQL and SQL query syntax. The training modules also included front-end development tools, such as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Thymeleaf, as well as testing with JUnit for Java.

In the second part of the bootcamp, I was able to further develop my skills in Spring and Spring Boot, which enabled me to create a web MVC application. This project will be documented in the same GitHub account at a later time...
